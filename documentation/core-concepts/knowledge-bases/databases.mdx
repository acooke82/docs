A database knowledge base connects your agent directly to structured data stored in a relational database. This allows the agent to retrieve rows, records, and facts in real time, based on user queries.

---

## How does it work?

Add a database knowledge base by entering the following:

- **Database Server URL**
- **Database Name**
- **Database Username**
- **Database Password**
- **Database Port**
- **Database Engine** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, Oracle)

Use the **Test DB Connection** button to confirm the connection is working before deploying.

Once connected, the agent queries the database when needed and returns structured results.

Responses reflect the current state of the database in real time.

## Best Practices

- **Use for Structured Data:** Databases are ideal for frequently updated, structured data like inventory, schedules, or customer records.
- **Document Your Schema:** Ensure table and field names are clear and well-documented so queries return meaningful results.
- **Secure Access:** Provide only the credentials and permissions the agent requires â€” avoid exposing sensitive data unnecessarily.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Always run the Test DB Connection to validate setup before production.
- **Plan for Performance:** Optimize large queries and avoid unnecessary load by tailoring endpoints to specific use cases.
