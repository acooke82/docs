Document knowledge bases allow you to store and retrieve information from files, notes, and created text. Documents are indexed using VIVI’s **RAGDB** system, which breaks content into chunks and uses **cosine similarity scoring** to return the most relevant results. 

This makes documents ideal for structured reference material, guides, and knowledge you want your agent to use consistently.

## How does it work?

Once you’ve created your **Document knowledge base**, your index will automatically begin provisioning. You can view the index status in the banner at the top of the page, showing:

- Number of documents **processed**
- Number of documents **processing**
- Number of documents that **failed ingestion**

You can add documents in three ways:

### Cloud

Connect directly to your cloud storage provider:

- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- OneDrive Personal
- OneDrive Work/School

Once connected, browse and import documents. After import:

- Documents are **indexed**
- Status will change from **Pending** to **Processed** once complete

### Create

Use the built-in editor to write and save new documents directly in VIVI.

Perfect for:

- Short guides
- FAQs
- Reference notes

Created documents are indexed like uploaded/cloud-based ones.

### Upload

Add files directly from your computer using one of two methods:

- **Via Browser:** Best for small files (< 1GB). Drag-and-drop or click to upload.
- **Via Storage Explorer:** Best for large files (> 1GB). Generates a temporary token for use with **Azure Storage Explorer**, enabling:
  - Faster transfer
  - Bulk uploads
  - Third-party collaborator access

> **Note:** After uploading via Storage Explorer, click **Sync Files** to complete the process.

## Best Practices

- **Use Cloud** if files are frequently updated — changes can be re-indexed without re-uploading
- **Use Create** for text-based additions like SOPs, notes, or FAQs
- **Use Upload** for local files or large file sets; prefer Storage Explorer for efficiency
- **Organize content into folders** for easier retrieval
- **Verify indexing status** — ensure files show as `Processed` before use in production
- **Remember:** Documents are indexed in **chunks**, so while great for retrieval, they won’t isolate metadata like author names or timestamps
