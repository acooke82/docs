title: 'URLs'
---

A **URL knowledge base** connects an agent to **live, real-time information** from a website.  
Unlike documents, URLs are **not indexed** â€” the agent fetches content from the site **each time it is queried**.

---

## How does it work?

1. **Add a URL** to your knowledge base list.
2. Click the **Test URL** button to confirm the site is accessible.
   - Some sites may be inaccessible due to:
     - CAPTCHAs
     - Anti-bot restrictions
     - Other access barriers
3. You can also test accessibility by **asking the agent about the site** and verifying its response.
4. When the agent receives a question, it **fetches the latest content in real time** from the specified URL.

## Best Practices

**Real-Time Only**  
URLs pull content directly from the web; nothing is cached or pre-indexed.

**No File Links**  
Avoid using URLs that point to downloadable files like `.pdf`, `.docx`, etc.  
Instead: Download the file and upload it via a **Document Knowledge Base**.

**Verification**  
Always test a new URL by asking the agent about it and validating the returned response for accuracy.

**Clarity**  
Use URLs that contain **clean, static, text-based content**.  
Avoid heavily scripted or dynamic pages that make extraction difficult.

**Limiters**  
If you want your agent to only use certain parts of your site:
- Use the **exact URL** to a specific page
- Avoid linking just the home page unless necessary
