title: 'API'
---

The API channel allows external systems to communicate directly with your agent using secure, programmatic endpoints. This enables you to integrate your VIVI agent into custom applications, back-end systems, or third-party workflows using HTTP-based calls.

---

## How It Works  
Once you create an API channel, you are provided with a unique:  

- **Channel ID** – Used in endpoint URLs to identify the API channel.  
- **API Key** – Used to authenticate requests to your agent.  

The interface also provides auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation outlining the available endpoints and their required parameters.

## Endpoints

| Name             | Method | Path                               | Description                      |
|------------------|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Stream Messages  | POST   | `/channelsApi/{channelId}/stream`   | Streams responses back progressively.  |
| Invoke Messages  | POST   | `/channelsApi/{channelId}/invoke`   | Sends a single message and receives output.  |
| Batch Messages   | POST   | `/channelsApi/{channelId}/batch`    | Sends multiple messages in one call.  |

Each endpoint supports payloads sent via POST requests and requires the `APIKeyHeader` for authorization. A test button is available next to each endpoint to validate behavior once the API channel is linked to a published agent.

## Best Practices  
- Keep your API key secret and rotate it if you suspect exposure.  
- Always test endpoints using the provided tools before connecting production systems.
