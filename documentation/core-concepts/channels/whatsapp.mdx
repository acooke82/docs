WhatsApp is a messaging channel that enables your agent to communicate directly with users via WhatsApp, supporting both one-to-one conversations and outbound campaigns.

--- 

## How It Works  
- Connect your WhatsApp Business account to VIVI.  
- Assign an agent to manage inbound chats or run outbound campaigns.  
- Use WhatsApp-approved message templates featuring buttons and calls-to-action.  
- When users respond, the agent takes over to continue the conversation naturally.

## Best Practices  
- Use clear, concise message templates approved by WhatsApp to minimize rejection risks.  
- Include strong calls-to-action such as confirming bookings, requesting information, or directing users to your site.  
- Ensure your agent has access to the necessary knowledge bases and integrations to respond effectively.  
- Utilize campaigns for timely outreach, then let the agent handle ongoing engagement.
