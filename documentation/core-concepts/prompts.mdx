title: 'Prompts'
---

A **prompt** is the set of written instructions that defines how an agent should act, respond, and communicate. Prompts shape the agent’s **role**, **tone**, and **rules of engagement**.

Each prompt has:
- A **name** for organization
- A **text body** written in plain text or Markdown
- **Version history** to track and manage changes over time

---

## Why It Matters

Prompts are the **foundation** of every agent. They determine how agents:

- Respond to user questions
- Use knowledge bases and integrations
- Maintain tone and behavior

| Benefit      | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Control**     | Customize agent behavior and tone exactly as you want                     |
| **Consistency** | Ensure all agents using the same prompt follow the same instructions       |
| **Flexibility** | Easily update, version, archive, or reuse prompts as your needs evolve     |

## How Prompts Work

### 1. **Set a Name**
Give each prompt a clear, descriptive name (e.g. `Customer Support Prompt`, `Internal HR Agent`, `Sales WebChat`).

### 2. **Add the Prompt Body**
Paste the prompt content in **plain text** or **Markdown**. This can include:

- Role instructions  
- Tone and voice guidelines  
- Guardrails (what the agent should or shouldn’t do)  
- Knowledge base and integration instructions  

### 3. **Save and Version**
Every time you save a prompt, it creates a **new version**. You can:

- View version history  
- Roll back to a previous version  
- Lock a version for active use  

### 4. **Archive and Reuse**
If you're no longer using a prompt, archive it. Archived prompts remain accessible for:

- Review  
- Reuse  
- Restoration

## Prompt Templates

To help you get started, VIVI provides **prebuilt prompt templates** for common use cases:

| Template             | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Customer Support** | Friendly and helpful tone, with instructions for handling support scenarios |
| **WebSearch Agent**  | Enables the agent to run live web lookups and cite external information     |

Templates can be fully customized after selection.

## Best Practices

- Write clearly and directly — be explicit about the agent’s goals and boundaries  
- Use bullet points, headings, or numbered steps for clarity  
- Include guardrails to prevent unwanted behavior  
- Reference how to use knowledge bases or tools (e.g. “Use the CRM integration for customer lookups”)
- Start with a **template**, then refine based on your use case
