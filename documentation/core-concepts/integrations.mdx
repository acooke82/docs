title: 'Integrations'
---

Integrations are how an agent **interacts with the outside world**. They extend agent capabilities by connecting to external systems and allow the agent to **perform tasks** on the user’s behalf.

---

## Why It Matters

Integrations turn your agent from a passive responder into an **active executor**.

- **Capability**: Extend into CRMs, ticketing systems, apps, etc.  
- **Action**: Let agents act — not just reply.  
- **Scalability**: Mix and match integrations to evolve with business needs.

---

## Types of Integrations

We currently support **three types** of integrations:

---

### 1. **Apps**

Apps are business software tools such as **HubSpot**, **Salesforce**, or **DocuSign**.

- Built on **MCP** (Model Context Protocol): An open-source framework that standardizes how tools connect to agents.
- Examples: Apollo.io, DocuSign, Duffel.
- Tools inside apps are **enabled by default** — disable them as needed when configuring your agent.
- Some apps require:
  - Admin setup
  - API keys or credentials

> MCP provides context directly to the agent, enabling intelligent tool use.

---

### 2. **APIs**

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) connect agents to external systems via HTTP.

- Must support **OpenAPI 3** schemas (JSON or YAML).
- You can generate or convert Swagger files to OpenAPI 3 format.
- Requires:
  - A **client API key**
  - **Documented endpoints** (e.g., `GET /tickets`, `POST /users`)
- APIs define what agents can *do* (e.g., view, create, update).

> Example: A helpdesk API may let agents *read tickets* but not *create them*, depending on the endpoint's permissions.

---

### 3. **Agents**

Agents can be integrated with **other agents**, enabling **multi-agent systems**.

- Ideal for complex workflows requiring specialized sub-agents.
- The *supervisor agent* determines when to call others.
- Key tips:
  - Use **clear names and descriptions**.
  - Understand that **multi-agent systems are slower** than single-agent setups.

> For most use cases, a single agent with multiple tools is more efficient than a fully distributed multi-agent system.

## How Agents Use Integrations

- Integrations are used via **MCP servers**, which guide agents to appropriate tools.
- Applications exposed through MCP provide **real-time context**.
- As the builder, you can:
  - Enable or disable tools
  - Prioritize certain integrations

---

## Best Practices

- Carefully review integration setup — especially **admin permissions** and **API keys**.
- **Test** all APIs and endpoints before deployment.
- Use **clear names** for agents, apps, APIs, and tools to avoid confusion.
- Don’t overload agents with too many sub-agents — balance efficiency with capability.
