## I had conversations with my agent. Why don't I see them in reports?

Reports run **every 4 hours** and only capture conversations that are **older than 24 hours**.

- If your conversation took place within the **last 24–28 hours**, please **wait and check again later**.
- The 24-hour buffer ensures conversations are **fully completed** before being included in the report, avoiding partial data.
