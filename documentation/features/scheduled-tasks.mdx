title: 'Scheduled Tasks'
---

Scheduled tasks are automated workflows that run at set intervals. They allow agents to handle repetitive or routine work without manual intervention. They are useful for tasks that need to be performed on a regular basis, such as sending emails, updating data, or generating reports.

## Why It Matters

- **Automation:** Removes the need for manual repetition.  
- **Consistency:** Ensures tasks are completed on schedule, every time.  
- **Efficiency:** Frees up staff time by offloading routine tasks to the agent.

## How Scheduled Tasks Work

1. **Set a Name**  
   Provide a clear task name for easy tracking.

2. **Select an Agent**  
   Choose the agent that will run the task.

3. **Add Instructions**  
   Define the steps or commands the agent should execute.

4. **Set a Schedule**  
   Choose when and how often the task runs (daily, weekly, specific time, etc.).

5. **Choose a Timezone**  
   Confirm the timezone so execution aligns with your business hours.

6. **Create and Activate**  
   Save the task. It will appear in your list of scheduled tasks, with status and next run time displayed.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names so tasks are easy to identify at a glance.  
- Write clear instructions that tell the agent exactly what to do.  
- Test new tasks before relying on them in production.  
- Review scheduled tasks periodically to confirm they are still needed and running correctly.  
- Align task schedules with business workflows to maximize impact.

## Common Use Cases

- **Daily Reports:** Generate and deliver a summary of KPIs, tickets, or campaign metrics at a set time.  
- **Data Sync:** Update records between CRMs, spreadsheets, or other integrated systems on a recurring basis.  
- **Reminder Messages:** Send WhatsApp, email, or chat reminders for appointments, renewals, or deadlines.  
- **Content Updates:** Refresh pricing sheets, FAQs, or knowledge bases by pulling new data automatically.  
- **System Checks:** Run a recurring evaluation of an agent or integration to verify performance and reliability.
