A **WhatsApp campaign** is a scheduled or on-demand communication sent through the WhatsApp channel. Campaigns allow you to broadcast messages, updates, or reminders directly to users who have opted in — and then continue the conversation when they respond.

## Why It Matters

WhatsApp campaigns transform messaging into a **two-way experience**. Instead of one-off blasts, your agent can guide conversations toward outcomes like confirmed bookings, product sales, or follow-up actions.

- **Reach:** Engage customers in one of the world’s most widely used messaging apps.
- **Automation:** Deliver campaigns at scale while the agent handles replies.
- **Conversion:** Use structured prompts and buttons to steer conversations toward measurable results.

## How WhatsApp Campaigns Work

### 1. Connect an Agent
Set up an agent that’s linked to a WhatsApp channel. Ensure it has the right knowledge to answer questions about the campaign content.

### 2. Create a Template
- Define the **template name and type**.
- Write your **message content** exactly as you want it delivered.
- Add **buttons** for clear calls to action (e.g., confirming an appointment, visiting your site).

### 3. Build the Campaign
- **Name the campaign** so you can track it later.
- Select the **template** you created.
- Upload a **contact file in CSV format** (columns must match the sample format — click _View Sample_ for guidance).

### 4. Schedule or Send
Choose to **launch immediately** or **set a schedule** for later delivery.

### 5. Conversation Handoff
Once messages are delivered:
- The **agent takes over**.
- It reads user replies, understands context, and continues the conversation — answering questions, sharing details, or guiding users to the next step.

## Best Practices

- Only message users who have **opted in** to WhatsApp communication.  
- Keep messages **short, clear, and actionable**.  
- Use **buttons or quick replies** to simplify next steps.  
- **Test templates** before sending campaigns at scale.  
- Align your **agent’s prompt** with the campaign goal to ensure consistent follow-up.
