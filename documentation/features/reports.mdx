title: 'Reports'

Reports provide insight into the conversations your agents are having. They come in two forms:

- **Agent Reports**: Pre-built reports that summarize performance across a specified time, agents, and channels. These measure general metrics like message counts, topics, and speed of reply.
- **Conversation Insights**: A detailed view of individual conversations, focusing on soft skills â€” how users felt about the conversation and whether the outcome was successful.

Together, these views help you measure both **operational efficiency** and **customer experience**.

## Why It Matters

Reports transform conversation data into **measurable results**. They highlight how well agents are serving customers, both in terms of what happened and how it was experienced.

- **Visibility**: Understand activity and outcomes across channels.
- **Quality Control**: Track sentiment, resolution, and user experience.
- **Optimization**: Refine prompts, knowledge bases, or integrations based on trends.
