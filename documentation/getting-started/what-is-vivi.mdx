## What is VIVI?

VIVI is a secure, enterprise-grade platform for building AI agents. Build, deploy, and scale AI agents that align with your goals. Connect them to the tools and systems you already use, allowing your agents to adapt seamlessly into your existing workflows.

**Why VIVI?** Don't want to play around with workflows, triggers, or code? No problem. VIVI is **no code**. Experience the power of a natural language system that you can use to automate quick, repetitive tasks or play around to build a complex, managed system. Learn a new skill, or automate ones you don't want to through voice or text. It's that simple.
