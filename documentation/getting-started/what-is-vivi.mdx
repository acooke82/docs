## Why VIVI?

| Capability | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Contextual Intelligence** | VIVI understands and reasons using your knowledge — documents, databases, and live web sources. |
| **Seamless Integrations** | Connect VIVI to the tools and systems you already use (CRMs, APIs, apps) so it can take real actions. |
| **Flexible & Scalable** | Design agents for growth — one per team or many specialized ones working together. |
| **Secure & Managed** | Control access through workspaces and accounts, and govern permissions at scale. |

## Core Components

### Knowledge Bases  
Teach VIVI using **documents**, **databases**, or live **URLs**. Use whichever combination fits your use case best.

### Integrations  
Plug VIVI into your systems: APIs, business apps, or even other agents, so it can move beyond conversation to execution.

### Agents  
Combine knowledge + integrations + prompts into modular agents. For complex problems, build **multi-agent systems**.

### Workspaces & Users  
Keep projects isolated. Assign users roles, manage permissions, and scale your adoption across teams.

### Subscription Plans  
Choose a plan that fits your usage: basic, pro, or enterprise. Scale as your needs grow.

## Use Cases & Applications

- **Customer Support & Automation** — Answer tickets, handle escalations, retrieve from your knowledge base.  
- **Internal Workflows** — Automate HR, operations, internal documentation access.  
- **Data‑Driven Q&A** — Query databases or spreadsheets in real time via chat.  
- **Tool Orchestration** — Trigger actions (e.g. create tickets, send emails) based on conversational logic.

## Get Started in Minutes

1. Create your **account & workspace**  
2. Upload or connect your **knowledge sources**  
3. Add **integrations or APIs**  
4. Build your first **agent**  
5. Test & deploy across channels (webchat, API, etc.)

## Principles We Live By

- **Use the Right Tool:** Use structured knowledge when possible; rely on live URLs for dynamic or changing content.  
- **Least Privilege:** Give agents only the access they need.  
- **Modularity Over Monoliths:** Compose agents rather than create one enormous monolithic assistant.  
- **Continuous Testing:** Always validate agent behavior in sandbox environments before launch.
