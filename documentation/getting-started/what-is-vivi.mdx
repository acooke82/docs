Got an idea and not sure how to implement it? Connect with our team here -- . We're here to help and excited to see what you'll build.

## Ready to Build?

1. Create your **account & workspace**
2. Upload or connect your **knowledge sources**
3. Add **integrations or APIs**
4. Build your first **agent**
5. Test & deploy across channels (webchat, API, etc.)

### Integrations

Plug VIVI into your systems: APIs, business apps, or even other agents, so it can move beyond conversation to execution.

### Agents

Combine knowledge + integrations + prompts into modular agents. For complex problems, build **multi-agent systems**.

### Workspaces & Users

Keep projects isolated. Assign users roles, manage permissions, and scale your adoption across teams.

### Subscription Plans

Choose a plan that fits your usage: basic, pro, or enterprise. Scale as your needs grow.

## Use Cases & Applications

- **Customer Support & Automation** — Answer tickets, handle escalations, retrieve from your knowledge base.
- **Internal Workflows** — Automate HR, operations, internal documentation access.
- **Data‑Driven Q&A** — Query databases or spreadsheets in real time via chat.
- **Tool Orchestration** — Trigger actions (e.g. create tickets, send emails) based on conversational logic.
- **Use the Right Tool:** Use structured knowledge when possible; rely on live URLs for dynamic or changing content.
- **Least Privilege:** Give agents only the access they need.
- **Modularity Over Monoliths:** Compose agents rather than create one enormous monolithic assistant.
- **Continuous Testing:** Always validate agent behavior in sandbox environments before launch.
