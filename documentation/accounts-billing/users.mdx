title: 'Users'
---

Users are the individuals who have access to a **workspace**. Each user is assigned a **role** that determines what they can view and manage inside the platform.

---

## Why It Matters

Proper user management ensures:

- **Control** — Limit access to billing or agent edits based on roles.  
- **Collaboration** — Let teams contribute in their areas of responsibility.  
- **Accountability** — Track access and actions by individual users.

## How Users Work

### Invite a User
Send an invitation to their email address from the Users page.

### Assign a Role
Define what each user can do by assigning them one of the available roles.

### Manage Seats
Workspaces have a limited number of **seats**. You can track usage at the top of the Users page.

### Monitor Activity
Check the **Last Sign In** column to see when each user last accessed the workspace.

## Roles and Permissions

| Role             | Permissions |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Workspace Admin** | Full access to all workspace resources. |
| **Agent Manager**   | Create/edit/delete agents, prompts, and channels. View knowledge bases and integrations. |
| **Content Manager** | Create/edit/delete knowledge bases and integrations. |
| **Billing Admin**   | View billing info and manage payment methods. |
| **Chat User**       | View and create chat threads in the workspace. |

## Best Practices

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only assign the access needed for a user’s role.
- **Review Roles Regularly:** Ensure responsibilities still align with assigned permissions.
- **Remove Inactive Users:** Free up seats and reduce security exposure.
- **Multiple Admins:** Always keep **at least two Workspace Admins** to avoid losing control of access.
