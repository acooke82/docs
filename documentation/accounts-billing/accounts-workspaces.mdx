title: 'Accounts & Workspaces'
---

In VIVI, you begin by creating an **account** on the platform. Each account includes a **default workspace** where you can start building and managing agents.

---

## Definitions

- **Account**  
  The umbrella identity that owns your subscription and provides top-level administration.

- **Workspace**  
  A contained environment within an account where agents, prompts, knowledge bases, integrations, and channels are managed.

> Each workspace requires its own subscription plan (**Basic** or **Pro**), meaning multiple workspaces in the same account can have different levels of access and features.

---

## Why It Matters

Understanding the distinction between accounts and workspaces helps ensure:

- **Separation of Control**  
  - *Account Admins* oversee all workspaces.  
  - *Workspace Admins* are limited to managing their specific workspace.

- **Flexibility**  
  Organize workspaces by department, region, or function  
  (e.g., customer-facing vs. internal support).

- **Scalability**  
  Add new workspaces with different subscription plans as your organization grows.

## How Accounts and Workspaces Work

### Accounts

- Created when you sign up for VIVI.
- Contain one or more **workspaces**.
- **Account Admins** have full control across all workspaces.
- Managed through the **Manage Account** section.

### Workspaces

- A **default workspace** is created automatically.
- Each additional workspace requires a separate subscription plan (**Basic** or **Pro**).
- Within a workspace, you can:
  - Create **agents and prompts**
  - Add **knowledge bases**, **integrations**, and **channels**
- Users added to a workspace **only exist in that workspace**.
- **Workspace Admins** have full rights **within their workspace only**.

---

## Managing Account Admins

- Navigate to **Manage Account** to:
  - Add or remove Account Admins
- Account Admins have full access across **all** workspaces within the account.

---

## Managing Workspace Users

- Use the **Users** section (see dedicated page) to:
  - Add users to a specific workspace
  - Assign roles such as:
    - Workspace Admin
    - Agent Manager
    - Content Manager
    - Billing Admin
    - Chat User

---

## Leaving or Deleting an Account

In the **Manage Account** panel, users can:

- **Leave Account**  
  Removes access to all workspaces and data.  
  Rejoining requires a new invitation.

- **Delete Account**  
  Permanently deletes **all data and settings**.  
  This action **cannot be undone**.

---

## Best Practices

- Use **separate workspaces** for different teams, regions, or use cases.
- Select the **appropriate subscription tier** for each workspace.
- Limit **Account Admins** to only those needing full oversight.
- Regularly **review workspace users** and roles.
- Be cautious with **account deletion or exit** â€” access is permanently lost.
